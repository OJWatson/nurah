\usage{
setup_temporal_structure(
  start_date,
  end_date = NULL,
  n_periods = NULL,
  resolution = c("day", "week", "month", "quarter", "year")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_date}{Date (or string in "YYYY-MM-DD" format) for the start of the simulation.}

\item{end_date}{Date (or string) for the end of the simulation. Either \code{end_date}
or \code{n_periods} must be provided (but not both).}

\item{n_periods}{Integer number of time periods to simulate at the output resolution
(ignored if \code{end_date} is provided).}

\item{resolution}{Time resolution for output periods. Options include \code{"day"},
\code{"week"}, \code{"month"}, \code{"quarter"}, or \code{"year"}.}
}
\value{
A list with two Date vectors: \code{time_seq_daily} (all daily dates in the
simulation) and \code{time_seq_out} (the start date of each output period at the
specified resolution).
}
\description{
Determines the sequence of daily dates and the sequence of output period start
dates based on a start date and either an end date or a number of periods, plus
a temporal resolution.
}
\details{
If \code{end_date} is provided, the daily sequence runs from \code{start_date}
to \code{end_date} inclusive. If \code{n_periods} is provided instead, the function
generates that many consecutive periods (at the given resolution) starting from
\code{start_date}, and computes an \code{end_date} to cover all those periods fully.
The output vector \code{time_seq_out} contains the start date of each period.

For example, if \code{start_date = "2025-01-15"} and \code{resolution = "month"}
with \code{n_periods = 2}, the output periods will start on 2025-01-15 and 2025-02-15,
and the daily sequence will run until 2025-03-14 to cover two full monthly periods
(since the second period runs from 2025-02-15 to 2025-03-14).

\examples{
# Using an end date
setup_temporal_structure(start_date = "2025-01-01", end_date = "2025-01-10", resolution = "day")
setup_temporal_structure(start_date = "2025-01-01", end_date = "2025-03-10", resolution = "month")

# Using number of periods (e.g., 3 monthly periods starting Jan 1, 2025)
setup_temporal_structure(start_date = "2025-01-01", n_periods = 3, resolution = "month")
}
